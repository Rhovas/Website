            <p>Hi there, I'm <a href="https://willbanders.dev">Blake Anderson</a>  - the creator of Rhovas. Since this
              page is about the history of Rhovas, I'll take the opportunity to use first-person 'I' here as I go
              through the story. Let's get started!</p>

            <p>The early motivation for creating a programming language came in December 2017, where I considered making
              a scripting language for custom behavior in a Minecraft plugin (which I ultimately decided wasn't
              practical). Later on, after having a plugin crash from mutating a <code class="has-text-dark">List</code>
              object that was actually an <code class="has-text-dark">ImmutableList</code>, I began considering what a
              language designed for mutability would look like.</p>
            <p>It wasn't until Summer 2018 when I started seriously planning out a language. The first notes for Rhovas
              were from July 11 (considered the anniversary of the language) and early problems I explored were
              mutability, error handling, and dependent types (not that I knew what they were at the time). The name
              Rhovas came about a week later, which was chosen due to the file extension (<code class="has-text-dark">.rho</code>,
              itself from density for fluid dynamics) and had a similar syllabic pattern with Kotlin. The name stuck,
              helped by its uniqueness for SEO.</p>

                <span>The Implementation Revolution</span>
              </h2>
            </div>
            <p>Over the next few years I worked on many iterations of the language and continued to learn more about
              programming language design/implementation as well as the particular problems I was trying to solve.
              <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com">Crafting Interpreters</a> was by far the most helpful resource
              early on, and I also used <a href="https://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> for a while before opting to
              handwrite a recursive-descent parser. I also discovered the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Kjt3ZE">r/ProgrammingLanguages Discord</a>,
              which really helped me when it came to language design.
            <p>Most of these attempts were built for things like hackathons or my senior project and didn't make it too
              far. I struggled a lot with managing scope for class instances - especially with inheritance - and never
              really made much progress with static analysis beyond the basics. I also tried a few times to compile to
              Java bytecode or just transpile to Java directly, which worked okay for simple features but was overall
              more complex than I could handle at the time. Nonetheless, each time I made it just a bit further and got
              <em>really</em> good at writing parsers.</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="level">
              <h2 id="onward-and-upward" class="level-item title" style="margin: 0">
                <span class="icon is-medium" style="margin-right: 0.25rem">
                  <a href="#onward-and-upward">
                    <i class="fas fa-sm fa-link" style="padding-bottom: 0.25rem"></i>
                  </a>
                </span>
                <span>Onward And Upward</span>
              </h2>
            </div>
            <p>In August 2020 I participated in the Repl.it LangJam (<a href="https://replit.com/talk/share/Rhovas-A-Language-for-API-Design-and-Enforcement/51789">Submission</a>)
              where I worked full-time to rebuild Rhovas from scratch and tackle a few new ideas that I had never gotten
              to. The largest one here was embedded DSLs, which has since become a key feature as well as being one of
              my main <a href="./research">research areas</a>.</p>
            <p>One year later, the current iteration of the language (and likely last before self-hosting) was started.
              Unlike the previous attempts, I kept the core language down to just statements and expressions before
              working on static analysis, and that really helped get through that hurdle. Additionally, I also
              emphasized strong test coverage which made refactoring much easier when I inevitably ran into issues.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, Rhovas is really starting to come together and we have a growing community on <a href="https://discord.gg/gm96xd8">Discord</a>
              too. There's still some core challenges that need to be solved before the language is really usable, but
              I'm making progress faster than ever and things are definitely looking up!</p>
